Experimenting w/ [Multipeer Connectivity Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity?language=objc) on iOS

My goal is to explore interesting use cases of peer-to-peer networking on iOS, such as:
- Texting with people nearby when nobody has internet/cellular connectivity (e.g. on an airplane)
- Voice chat (walkie-talkie) w/ people nearby (for example 2 people riding a motorcycle using iPhone+Airpods as a communication headset)

I'm using Obj-C for the added challenge (there are already several Swift examples available on the web).
